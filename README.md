# SimpleLinearEquationDrawer
JS code that takes simple linear equations in the from of 'y = mx + b'.

It can take simple linear equations in the form of 'y = mx + b'.
As these lines weren't going to be on a graph, I didn't pay attention
to graphing their 'y-intercept' or 'b'.

To use the object, just use the 'init()' function in a browser.
